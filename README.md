# 🛡️ Healthcare Cybersecurity Visuals & Concepts

Welcome! This repository showcases a set of visuals I created as part of my journey into **Cybersecurity in Healthcare**, powered by **AI**, **network security**, and a lot of curiosity. I'm a recent graduate in **Health Informatics**, and I'm exploring how technology can protect patient data while improving care.
